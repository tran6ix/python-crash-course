#Changing case in string with methods
name = "jordan tran"
print(name.title())
#title function changes each word to upper-case
name = "Jordan Tran"
print(name.upper())
print(name.lower())
#upper does all leters in uppercase and vice versa
#lower method is usually used to store data when you don't trust users with capitalization
